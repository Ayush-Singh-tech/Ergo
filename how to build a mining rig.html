        <h3 class="sub-head">Purchasing Hardware</h3>
        <p>It’s important to note - you can buy a completely built PC.</p>
        <p>
          Or you can purchase parts separately using a website’s PC builder
          feature. Something like newegg has a complete walk through and you can
          participate in their shuffle program to get hard to find chips.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third option is to completely build it yourself and find the best
          deal you can on individual parts. This tutorial will illustrate this
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest thing you’ll want to consider is - what do I want to do
          with this machine?
        </p>
        <p>
          Will this be used for more than mining? Do I require a lot of storage?
          - do I have a lot of photos or videos? Will I be downloading a lot of
          blockchain data? What about write/read speeds? Should I go for a newer
          hard drive or an older model? Memory, processors, power supplies, etc.
          will all be covered in this tutorial. Indeed, this process starts with
          the following questionnaire which assists in hardware selections and
          basic understanding of a computing system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para-decor para-gap">
        <div class="store-img-left">
          <img src="images\storage.svg" alt="Storage" />
        </div>
        <div class="store-content">
          <h3 class="sub-head">Storage</h3>
          <p>
            The first question you need to answer is: how much storage do you
            need? These days, it's possible to have over a hundred 5 terabyte+
            drives controlled by the same computer. So feel free to think big if
            you can afford it! For crypto purposes, I can tell you the Ergo
            blockchain required to run the Ergo wallet is currently at about 15
            gigabytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second question to ask is: how fast do I need this storage to
            be? When you ask this question, keep this in mind - your system is
            only as fast as your worst bottleneck across all components. In
            other words, if you had the world's fastest hard drive, it doesn’t
            matter if the system’s processor can’t keep up. When it comes to
            hard drive speed, a general rule of thumb is that a magnetic drive
            is slower than a solid state drive. And a solid state drive is
            slower than an m2 solid state drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently, blockchain and blockchain wallet software require good
            read/write speed in order to download and sync a fresh copy of the
            blockchain, or else you spend weeks trying to sync. Once the chain
            is synced however, magnetic drives are sufficient to download new
            blocks and run the chain.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=" para-decor para-gap">
        <div class="store-content">
          <h3 class="sub-head">Memory</h3>
          <p>
            The next system component to consider is memory. Memory is faster
            than hard drive storage, but is temporary in nature. Think of it as
            a cache for programs loaded from the hard drive. The Ergo blockchain
            requires at least 4gb of memory to download and sync, but benefits
            from 8gb. When it comes to memory size, think
            <span class="highlight">“as much as I can fit and afford”. </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as types, a general rule of thumb is: the higher the DDR, the
            faster it is. I.e. DDR3 is faster than DDR2. DDR5 is faster than
            DD4. Again, if you select a fast m2 solid state drive hard drive,
            your system will be degraded if you pair it with a slow DD2 set of
            memory sticks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of sticks you may purchase depends on the motherboard you
            select in a few steps. However, you’ll want to select a few more
            components before you choose a motherboard to tie it all together!
          </p>

      <div class="para-full-width para-gap">
        <h3 class="sub-head">Processing Units</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you’ve selected your storage devices, it’s time to select
          processing power! In general, there’s two types of processors out
          there - a central processing unit and a graphics processing unit. More
          accurately, a serial processing unit and a parallel processing unit
          respectively. For mining, you will require both processors, but the
          parallel unit (the GPU) is the most important piece of this whole
          system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para-decor para-gap">
        <div class="store-img-left"><img src="images\Gpu.svg" alt="Gpu" /></div>
        <div class="store-content">
          <h3 class="sub-head">GPU</h3>
          <p>
            Mining is parallel in nature. It’s similar to guessing at an iPhone
            password - two people (or serial processors) can split the work by
            asking person A to start at 499 and going down and person B starting
            at 501 and going up. With a parallel unit, we can guess all 9999
            possibilities at once and process chunks of data instead of pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend visiting our hardware comparison page for assistance in
            selecting a graphics processing unit. This list includes stocked
            vendors.
          </p>
          <p class="alert">
            <img
              src="images/akar-icons_triangle-alert.svg"
              alt="alert"
            />Important! - Make sure your GPU unit has enough on board memory to
            mine your selected coin. Ergo requires 4gb on the chip.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="para-full-width para-gap">
        <h3 class="sub-head">CPU</h3>
        <p>
          Every computer still needs a serial processor however - a central
          processing unit, CPU. When it comes to CPUs, the first question you’ll
          want to ask yourself is: what type of architecture do I need?
        </p>
        <p>
          Newer architectures such as ARM have been patented to include better
          energy savings and more power. Their cutting edgeness may mean some
          software isn’t supported by it just yet however. The older
          architecture, x86, is the most popular architecture and is widely
          supported. In my experience, I recommend sticking to x86 for Ergo.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, you’ll just need to ask “how much power do I need?”.
          Remember, mining rigs benefit from parallel (GPU) processing, not
          serial processing. Other functions like video editing, graphic design,
          or gaming will benefit however. If you are still wondering whether or
          not you need a strong CPU, keep in mind that most software functions
          have been developed around serial processing. Very few specialized
          applications, such as gaming and mining, have benefited from
          parallelism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vendor is a matter of preference, but in general - an Intel I7 is
          stronger than an I5 and a Ryzen 9 is stronger than a Ryzen 7.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para-full-width para-gap">
        <h3 class="sub-head">Motherboard</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you know what type of components you’d like to run, it’s time
          to choose the glue to put it all together - the motherboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motherboard is the chip that coordinates the communication between
          all the specific chips you just selected. Your primary goal in
          selecting a motherboard is ensuring that it has sufficient slots for
          your components. You’ll want to check the specs of your components to
          see the type of slots they need. A few examples may include ensuring
          you have m2 slots if you chose an m2 hard drive, or making sure you
          have the right type of slot for your processing units.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anothering thing you’ll want to consider is the amount of slots. Do
          you have enough memory slots? Enough hard drive slots?
        </p>
        <p>
          One important thing to remember is that mining power directly
          correlates to the amount of GPUs in the machine. If mining power is
          the primary goal, make sure you get a motherboard that has multiple
          GPU slots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important thing to remember is physical space. Newer GPUs are
          huge! Memory sticks are smaller. SSD hard drives require more physical
          space, but are easier to cool than M2 hard drives. The motherboard’s
          “form factor” is a primary factor you’ll want to consider here. The
          larger the form factor, the more components it can hold, and the more
          physical space you’ll have, but it also means more energy and a larger
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet another important consideration is your physical spacing of
          components. Optimal airflow is critical. We’ll cover cooling in
          greater detail in the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motherboard’s chipset is a general processing chip that
          facilitates the communication between all these components. This can
          be a system bottleneck, so review your chip before your purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final thing to consider is onboard components. The motherboard
          often comes with less performance critical components such as USB
          drives, bluetooth, wireless, and even basic graphics capability. You
          can accept these onboard components and purchase a motherboard with
          some included functionality, or you can select stronger components if
          performance is an issue. I.e. Some people opt to purchase a good
          networking chipset. If you choose specialized components for any of
          these areas, make sure your motherboard supports it as well.

          <h3 class="sub-head">Cooling</h3>
          <p>
            All this power! All this surging electrical energy leaves a waste
            product (heat) that requires a category of maintenance hardware to
            keep it functioning, and that’s cooling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">“Cooling”</span> is an overall effort that
            includes a multitude of external factors such as the location of the
            machine and time of the year. To assist in this effort, you’ll need
            to purchase important components just as air circulating fans and
            processor cooling units. Cooling can include dehumidification as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain components such as GPUs come with onboard fans. You can also
            purchase additional liquid CPU coolers as well. I recommend you
            purchase these if you can!
          </p>
          <p>
            A general rule of thumb is that you need a way for external cool air
            to get in, and for hot waste air to get out. Certain machine cases
            are designed for this specifically, but you may also run across
            certain setups with no case at all and huge external fans cooling
            exposed components.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight"
              >Interesting thought - Is this heat really “waste”? What can we
              use it for?</span
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            There are plenty of creative ways to cool components which I invite
            you to explore. In general, you want to keep chips cooler than 80
            degree celsius, but follow your specific hardware’s recommendations.
          </p>

            <img src="images/akar-icons_triangle-alert.svg" alt="alert" />Alert:

            Next, you’ll want to select a power supply unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Power supplies are graded according to their efficiency and noise level.  A Gold power unit is quieter and more efficient than a silver unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend going to an online power calculator to select a sufficient wattage unit. You’ll want to make sure you have enough to power your selected components, any cool lights you’ll want on your case, and possible future components as well. 
            <p>Ensure your power supply fits in your machine’s case.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-head">Your case</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, your case!  As I’ve mentioned, it’s also possible to have no case at all.  Certain high performance mining rigs are held together with affordable, yet custom, home depot metal material; even wood.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you decide to buy a commercial case however, you’ll want to consider size and support.  If you purchased a large form factor motherboard, make sure you have a large form factor case.  Also, make sure you have enough screw slots to properly place your components.  Additionally, certain components we selected earlier may not have come with screws.  M2 hard drives are notorious for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two final factors to consider here are cooling, and “cool” ;).  As I’ve drilled, your case needs to have sufficient airflow to cool the components it houses.  It’s also responsible for housing the cool LED lights you may see on some machines!  I invite you to research commercial cases that are specifically made for cooling.

            Before that however, you’ll need operating system software to run the machine.  Make sure you purchase the correct operating software for your CPU architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            A popular, but commercial, operating system is Windows.  If you’re more tech oriented and/or are looking for something that is free and open sourced, Linux Ubuntu is an excellent option.  If you plan on accessing this machine passively and/or remotely, the server edition of your operating system may be appropriate.

You’ll want to follow your component’s guides for instructions on how to connect everything together.  Be sure to keep an eye out for component clearance and airflow.  It’s not uncommon to have to return a part or two when you find it doesn’t fit.
